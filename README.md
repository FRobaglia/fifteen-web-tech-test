# Fifteen Web Tech Test

Technical test for Web Developer position at <a href="https://fifteen.eu/" style="color: #ff0062">Fifteen âœ³</a>

## Features

Based on [Vitesse Lite](https://github.com/antfu/vitesse-lite), we removed all the opinionated features.
They still can be used wisely, against the developer choice.

We kept the minimal vite starter with few tree updates, alongside **Vue 3**, **Typescript** and **VueUse**.
We prefered `yarn` over `pnpm`.

## Getting started

Clone this repository and run `yarn`. All the available commands are listed in `package.json` for further development.
